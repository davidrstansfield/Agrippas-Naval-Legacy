## Factual Assessment: Agrippa’s Movements Largely Unknown?

The historical record is sparse, with Cassius Dio providing the primary evidence.

Below, we list known details, unknown or speculative aspects, and questions for further research.

### Known Details

1. **September 2, 31 BC: At Actium**
   - **Location**: Actium, Greece.
   - **Activity**: Led Octavian’s fleet to victory.
   - **Source**: Velleius Paterculus[^vp-2-LXXXV]; Plutarch, *Life of Antony*.
   - **Reasoning**: Multiple sources confirm Agrippa’s role, ensuring high confidence.

2. **Late 31 BC: Sent to Italy**
   - **Location**: Italy (likely Rome or Brundisium).
   - **Activity**: Managed veterans, held authority over Octavian’s letters, received sphinx seal.
   - **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51.
   - **Reasoning**: Dio’s specific account aligns with Agrippa’s role. Confidence is high for Italy, medium for exact location.

3. **Early 29 BC – August 29 BC: In Rome**
   - **Location**: Rome.
   - **Activity**: Conducted census, purged Senate, prepared triumph.
   - **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51; Britannica.
   - **Reasoning**: Governance tasks and triumph preparations confirm presence. High confidence.

[^vp-2-LXXXV]: Velleius Paterculus, *Compendium of Roman History*, [Book 2, LXXXV](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#85)

### Unknown or Speculative

1. **September 31 BC – August 30 BC: Exact Movements**
   - **Gap**: No details on Agrippa’s activities during the Egyptian campaign.
   - **Possibilities**: Likely in Italy managing logistics (e.g., fleet supplies for 40,000 troops). Brief trips to Brundisium plausible; Corinth, Judea, Syria unsupported.
   - **Questions**: Did Agrippa visit Greek ports? Are there unrecorded Eastern activities?

2. **Fleet Locations Post-Actium**
   - **Gap**: Unclear where Agrippa’s fleet was based.
   - **Possibilities**: Brundisium (Italy) or Leucas/Methone (Greece) likely; Corinth possible but speculative.
   - **Questions**: Are there archaeological records of fleet bases?

3. **Other Regions (e.g., Judea, Syria, Illyricum)**
   - **Gap**: No evidence of Agrippa’s presence.
   - **Possibilities**: Logistical oversight of Syrian campaign plausible but speculative. Judea minor; Herod met Octavian in Rhodes (Josephus, *Jewish Antiquities* 15.187–201).
   - **Questions**: Are there regional sources mentioning Agrippa?
