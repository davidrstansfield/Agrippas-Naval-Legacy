# Agrippa's Naval Legacy

This repository, **Agrippa's Naval Legacy**, is a research project exploring Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa’s naval contributions (38–12 BCE), with a focus on the Battle of Actium (31 BCE), post-Actium movements (31–29 BCE), and the role of Augustan propaganda in shaping his legacy. It expands on the earlier [Actium-Campaign](https://github.com/davidrstansfield/Actium-Campaign) project to provide a comprehensive study of Agrippa’s life and career.

## Project Scope

- **Primary Focus**: Agrippa’s naval career (38–12 BCE), including key campaigns (e.g., Mylae/Naulochus 36 BCE, Actium 31 BCE) and movements from Actium to Octavian’s triumph (31–29 BCE).
- **Secondary Focus**: Agrippa’s life (63–12 BCE), including early years and post-29 BCE roles (e.g., administrative duties, possible Spanish campaigns).
- **Historiographical Focus**: Identifying missing sources that could clarify Agrippa’s naval contributions and their portrayal in Augustan propaganda (30s BCE onward).
- **Community Engagement**: Encouraging contributions to address source gaps and refine historical understanding.

## Repository Structure

- **/Life-Overview**: Agrippa’s biography and timeline (63–12 BCE).
- **/Naval-Career**: Detailed analysis of naval campaigns, Actium to triumph, and missing sources.
- **/Propaganda**: Augustan propaganda’s impact on Agrippa’s legacy.
- **/References**: Bibliography and source gaps.
- **/Contributing**: Guidelines for community contributions.

## Methodology

The project draws on primary sources (e.g., Cassius Dio, Velleius Paterculus) and secondary sources (e.g., Everitt’s *Augustus*, *Cambridge Ancient History, Volume X*). Gaps in the historical record are highlighted, with a call for community input to address them. Contributions are reviewed for accuracy and relevance.
