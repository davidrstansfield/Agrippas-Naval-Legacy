## Agrippa’s Naval Legacy: Actium and Beyond

* **Primary Focus:** Agrippa’s naval career (38–12 BCE), with detailed attention to movements between Actium (31 BCE) and Octavian’s triumph (29 BCE).  
* **Secondary Focus:** Agrippa’s broader life (63–12 BCE), including early years and post-29 BCE activities (e.g., administrative roles, possible Spanish campaigns).  
* **Historiographical Focus:** Missing sources that would illuminate Agrippa’s naval contributions and Augustan propaganda (30s BCE onward).  
* **Minimal Propaganda Section:** Highlight how missing sources relate to propaganda (e.g., anti-Antony narratives) without requiring extensive reference-checking.
