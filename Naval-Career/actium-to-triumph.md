# Agrippa’s Movements: September 2, 31 BC – August 13, 29 BC

This document outlines Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa’s naval and political activities from the Battle of Actium (September 2, 31 BCE) to Octavian’s triumph in Rome (August 13–15, 29 BCE), a critical period in consolidating Augustan power.

Due to limited primary sources, some details remain speculative. Contributions are welcome to clarify Agrippa’s movements.

## Known Details

### September 2, 31 BCE: Battle of Actium

- **Location**: Actium, Greece
- **Activity**: Led Octavian’s fleet to victory against Antony and Cleopatra
- **Sources**: Velleius Paterculus, *Compendium of Roman History* [Book 2, LXXXV](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#85); Plutarch, *Life of Antony*
- **Confidence**: High, based on multiple corroborating sources

### Late 31 BCE: Return to Italy

- **Location**: Italy (likely Rome or Brundisium)
- **Activity**: Managed veteran resettlement, held authority over Octavian’s correspondence, received sphinx seal
- **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51
- **Confidence**: High for Italy, medium for exact location (Rome vs. Brundisium)

### Early 29 BCE – August 29 BCE: In Rome

- **Location**: Rome
- **Activity**: Conducted census, purged Senate, prepared Octavian’s triumph
- **Sources**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51; *Encyclopaedia Britannica* (s.v. “Agrippa”)
- **Confidence**: High, based on governance and triumph preparations

## Unknown or Speculative Details

### September 31 BCE – August 30 BCE: Post-Actium Movements

- **Gap**: No clear record of Agrippa’s activities during the Egyptian campaign
- **Speculation**: Likely managed logistics in Italy (e.g., fleet supplies for 40,000 troops). Possible brief visits to Brundisium; Greek ports (e.g., Corinth) or eastern regions (e.g., Judea, Syria) are unsupported.
- **Questions**: Did Agrippa oversee naval operations in the eastern Mediterranean? Are there unrecorded logistical roles?

### Fleet Locations Post-Actium

- **Gap**: Unclear where Agrippa’s fleet was stationed
- **Speculation**: Likely Brundisium (Italy) or Leucas/Methone (Greece); Corinth possible but speculative
- **Questions**: Are there archaeological records of fleet bases in Greece or Italy?

### Presence in Other Regions (e.g., Judea, Syria)

- **Gap**: No evidence of Agrippa’s presence in Judea, Syria, or Illyricum
- **Speculation**: Logistical oversight of Syrian campaign plausible but unconfirmed. Judea unlikely, as Herod met Octavian in Rhodes (Josephus, *Jewish Antiquities* 15.187–201).
- **Questions**: Do regional sources (e.g., inscriptions) mention Agrippa?
