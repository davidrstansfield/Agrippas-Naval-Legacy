## Known Details

### September 2, 31 BCE: Battle of Actium

- **Location**: Actium, Greece
- **Activity**: Led Octavian’s fleet to victory against Antony and Cleopatra
- **Sources**: Velleius Paterculus, *Compendium of Roman History* [Book 2, LXXXV](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#85); Plutarch, *Life of Antony*
- **Confidence**: High, based on multiple corroborating sources

### Late 31 BCE: Return to Italy

- **Location**: Italy (likely Rome or Brundisium)
- **Activity**: Managed veteran resettlement, held authority over Octavian’s correspondence, received sphinx seal
- **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51
- **Confidence**: High for Italy, medium for exact location (Rome vs. Brundisium)

### Early 29 BCE – August 29 BCE: In Rome

- **Location**: Rome
- **Activity**: Conducted census, purged Senate, prepared Octavian’s triumph
- **Sources**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51; *Encyclopaedia Britannica* (s.v. “Agrippa”)
- **Confidence**: High, based on governance and triumph preparations

## Unknown or Speculative Details

### September 31 BCE – August 30 BCE: Post-Actium Movements

- **Gap**: No clear record of Agrippa’s activities during the Egyptian campaign
- **Speculation**: Likely managed logistics in Italy (e.g., fleet supplies for 40,000 troops). Possible brief visits to Brundisium; Greek ports (e.g., Corinth) or eastern regions (e.g., Judea, Syria) are unsupported.
- **Questions**: Did Agrippa oversee naval operations in the eastern Mediterranean? Are there unrecorded logistical roles?

### Fleet Locations Post-Actium

- **Gap**: Unclear where Agrippa’s fleet was stationed
- **Speculation**: Likely Brundisium (Italy) or Leucas/Methone (Greece); Corinth possible but speculative
- **Questions**: Are there archaeological records of fleet bases in Greece or Italy?

### Presence in Other Regions (e.g., Judea, Syria)

- **Gap**: No evidence of Agrippa’s presence in Judea, Syria, or Illyricum
- **Speculation**: Logistical oversight of Syrian campaign plausible but unconfirmed. Judea unlikely, as Herod met Octavian in Rhodes (Josephus, *Jewish Antiquities* 15.187–201).
- **Questions**: Do regional sources (e.g., inscriptions) mention Agrippa?
